Well, I don't want to hear
Or I don't want to be
But the drug set you free
And I'm here to recognize

I know a lot of heroes who never stop singing
But you already know
You asked for this
You made me compromise

It's not like this will be the last time he beats on you
And on the god inside
His cigarette
Carries your medicine

"It's what I want to know"
"It's what I had to do for me"
"You might change"
Those words are written on a tiny megaphone aimed at me

How long before they sweep us out of this place?
If you cooperate I think you will change
How will your architecture stand in this storm without the means to let me carry you off?

It's like they never stop singing
I know a lot of heroes who never stop singing
But you already know
You asked for this
You made me compromise

Well I don't want to heal or I don't want to "be"
Stay with me, stay to recognize these facts
I want to know
Why won't you carry on for me? (You might change)
If we are not our blood (In fact the opposite) why don't you take it out on me?

While I'm not into this, I will do what I'm told to do, how you ask me to
Although I'm not in
I will do
Ask me to
