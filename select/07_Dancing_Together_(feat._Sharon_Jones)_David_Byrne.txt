Went to the house of Mary Lasker
Saw Matisses, Picassos, Renoirs and Gauguins
Golf course and flowers, statues and stables
I met a Whitney, Rockefeller and Brown!

And they were dancin', dancing together
Dancin', oh so beautifully
Dancin', dancing together
Dancin', oh as if in a dream

Charles Jourdan, Oleg Cassini
There was Andy Warhol and Hanae Mori
Beautiful products all over the table
Fills my heart up with thoughts of my people

And they were dancin', dancing together...

I love my little people
You don't know what it's like
I'd rather be back in my Leyte
Back in the Quonset hut

Ali Hassan, Margot Fonteyn
Christina Onassis and the Queen of Spain
Beautiful women in beautiful homes
Just out of reach if your skin's colored brown

And they'll be dancin', dancing together...

"Hello Mr. Zeibel? Yes, my name is Jane Ryan-Mr. Saunders and I would like to make a deposit:"

Mm-hmm, now listen:
Breakfast with George, disco with George
It must be us who truly serve!
